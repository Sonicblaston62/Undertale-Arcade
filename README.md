# Undertale Arcade


This is my take on making Undertale for Makecode Arcade. The project will be updated here. But for further news. check it out [here](https://forum.makecode.com/t/undertale-arcade-devlog/32377).


Because of the limited tile-size in Makecode, I have to scale all art down by 20%. The game itself will be as close to the original as possible. 
Btw I have no idea how to use discord so don't sue me if I do something wrong.


Currently the game contains the first two rooms of the ruins, Frisk, save points, and door transitions. 
There is also alot of art that hasn't been implemented into the game yet. that includes Toriel overworld and battlesprite. half of the story cutscenes and an Annoying Dog?
